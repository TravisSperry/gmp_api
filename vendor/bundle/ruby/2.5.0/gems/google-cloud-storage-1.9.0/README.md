# google-cloud-storage

[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) ([docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/)) allows you to store data on Google infrastructure with very high reliability, performance and availability, and can be used to distribute large data objects to users via direct download.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ gem install google-cloud-storage
```

## Authentication

This library uses Service Account credentials to connect to Google Cloud services. When running on Compute Engine the credentials will be discovered automatically. When running on other environments the Service Account credentials can be specified by providing the path to the JSON file, or the JSON itself, in environment variables.

Instructions and configuration options are covered in the [Authentication Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-storage/guides/authentication).

## Example

```ruby
require "google/cloud/storage"

storage = Google::Cloud::Storage.new(
  project_id: "my-project",
  credentials: "/path/to/keyfile.json"
)

bucket = storage.bucket "task-attachments"

file = bucket.file "path/to/my-file.ext"

# Download the file to the local file system
file.download "/tasks/attachments/#{file.name}"

# Copy the file to a backup bucket
backup = storage.bucket "task-attachment-backups"
file.copy backup, file.name
```
